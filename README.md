## What is this?

Welcome to our library, which is designed to support the development of cutting-edge applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in dotnet.

As you may know, LLMs are an exciting and rapidly-evolving technology that offers developers unprecedented natural language processing and generation capabilities. 
However, LLMs can achieve their full potential when used in conjunction with other sources of computation or knowledge.

Our library helps you integrate LLMs with other tools and resources to create powerful and sophisticated applications. 
Some examples of solutions that you could create using our library include:

- Summarization
- Question Answering
- Code Generation
- Chatbots
- and much more
